# WARNING - DO NOT USE THIS, YET
This repo will stand up a google compute engine instance running node-red on a public, internet facing IP address.  *THIS IS BAD.*  Anyone.on the internet will be able to find, access, and abuse your instance.  

## Future
I want to get this working with IAP so that only the authenticated user can access the system.  It looks like that requires an authenticated domain, though.  So zero-cost might now work.
